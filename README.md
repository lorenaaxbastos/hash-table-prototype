# Building a hash table in Python with TDD

Digging deeper into the realm of Python dictionaries, I stumbled upon a fascinating topic: hash tables! In fact, Python dictionaries can be considered a type of hash table...

The goal here is to comprehend how this data structure operates behind the scenes. So, why not learn how to construct my own version of a dictionary (or hash table)?

## What is a hash table?

As explained by [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-hash-table/#build-a-hash-table-prototype-in-python-with-tdd), a hash table is a data structure that proves helpful in solving various everyday problems, such as indexing database tables, caching computed values, or implementing sets.

## Why is it important to master this subject?

Besides being a common topic in job interviews, hash tables are extensively used in Python! I am particularly passionate about the language, and understanding its core is a must for me. Let's embark together on this journey of building our own hash table in Python with TDD!
